## feat: add initial README and Jupyter notebook files (7942e58)

Initial addition of README and empty Jupyter notebook files

Introduces a README file and an empty Jupyter notebook (Untitled1.ipynb) along with their .ipynb_checkpoints counterparts, establishing the initial project structure for documentation and future code development.

### Changes

- Added `.ipynb_checkpoints/README-checkpoint.md` with a single line referencing the project name.
- Added an empty Jupyter notebook `.ipynb_checkpoints/Untitled1-checkpoint.ipynb` and `Untitled1.ipynb`.
- All files are new additions; no changes to existing files.

### Impact

- No behavioral changes, as only documentation and empty notebook files are introduced.
- No dependencies or existing code affected.
- No breaking changes or performance implications.
- Lays groundwork for future documentation and notebook-based development.
